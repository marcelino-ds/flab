# Architecture & Design Decisions

This document explains *why* flab is built the way it is. The code shows what; this
shows the reasoning behind the non-obvious choices.

## System overview

flab spans four browser-extension surfaces that communicate via `chrome.runtime` messaging:

```
┌──────────┐   START    ┌───────────┐   OPEN_AI    ┌────────────┐
│  popup   │ ─────────▶ │  content  │ ───────────▶ │ background │
│ launcher │            │  (LMS)    │              │  (worker)  │
└──────────┘            └───────────┘              └────────────┘
                              ▲                          │ opens tab
                       FILL_ANSWER / RETRY               ▼
                              │                    ┌────────────┐
                              └──────────────────  │  injector  │
                                 SOLVER_JSON_RESULT │  (Gemini)  │
                                                    └────────────┘
```

1. **popup** starts a session.
2. **content** (on the LMS page) finds the active question, extracts it, and asks background to open the LLM.
3. **background** (service worker) manages the LLM tab and relays messages.
4. **injector** (on the LLM page) injects the prompt, observes the streamed reply, extracts a JSON answer, and sends it back.
5. **content** fills the answer and drives the quiz's check/navigate flow.

## Key decisions

### 1. Text-first extraction, not screenshots

Moodle does **exact string matching** on multiple-choice options. OCR from a
screenshot routinely corrupts `0`/`O`, whitespace, and punctuation, which breaks
matching. Reading option text straight from the DOM is lossless. Screenshots are
used only as a fallback when a question genuinely contains non-text content
(diagrams, images), and even then the DOM text is sent alongside.

### 2. Structure-preserving extraction (HTML → Markdown)

`innerText` flattens tables, code blocks, and math into ambiguous text. For a
CS practicum that is full of I/O tables and code, that loses exactly the
information the model needs. `html-to-markdown.js` converts the question subtree
to Markdown: tables become Markdown tables, `<pre>` becomes fenced code, and
MathJax (v2 `script[type=math/tex]`, v3/MathML `annotation`) is pulled out as
LaTeX source rather than its broken rendered text.

### 3. Index-aligned answer filling

The fragile way to fill a multiple-choice answer is to match the model's answer
*text* against on-screen options — two similar options cause mis-clicks. Instead,
`moodle-options.js` derives the option list from the **same input elements that
will be clicked**, and numbers them. The model is told to return that number as
the authoritative signal. Because enumeration order and click order come from one
source, the index can be trusted; text is kept only as a cross-check. This
removed an entire class of "almost-right" mis-fills.

### 4. Balanced-brace JSON extraction

The model's answer is a JSON block embedded in free-form streamed text. The naive
`text.lastIndexOf('}')` breaks on two common cases: code answers full of `{}`, and
trailing prose after the block. `json-extract.js` walks from the opening brace
counting depth while being aware of strings and escapes, returning the true
matching close. This is the single highest-leverage correctness fix — it's what
makes coding answers parse reliably. It's also pure and unit-tested.

### 5. Verify fills before claiming success

Synthetic `ClipboardEvent`/paste into the Ace editor often silently no-ops. The
old code returned `true` regardless, so the flow would "check" an empty editor and
loop on retries. Fillers now read the editor back and compare before reporting
success, falling through to the next method otherwise.

### 6. Idempotent injection

The content script is auto-injected by the manifest *and* re-injected on demand.
Top-level `const` declarations would throw `already declared` on re-injection, so
the entire script is guarded by a `window.__flabAI` flag set before any
declaration. The esbuild IIFE format reinforces this by wrapping each surface in a
closure.

### 7. Circuit breaker on the retry loop

CodeRunner questions can retry (precheck fail → re-solve). Three independent retry
budgets could compound and open the LLM tab indefinitely. A hard per-session cap on
solve dispatches (`MAX_SOLVE_DISPATCH`) is a backstop that guarantees termination
without rewriting the retry logic.

### 8. esbuild bundle pipeline

The content script grew to ~2000 lines. Splitting it into ES modules is the clean
fix, but Chrome content scripts don't support ES modules directly. esbuild bundles
each surface to an IIFE (`--format=iife`), which simultaneously enables true
modularity, unit-testing of pure modules, and the idempotency guarantee from #6.

### 9. Provider registry (pluggable LLM)

All provider-specific knowledge — chat URL, editor/send/bubble selectors — lives in
`src/shared/providers.js`, not scattered across the injector and background. The
injector logic is generic: it resolves a provider from `payload.ai` and drives
whatever selectors that entry defines. Adding ChatGPT or Claude is a matter of
adding one registry entry, a manifest host-permission + content-script line, and
**verifying the selectors against the live site** — not editing flow logic.

> real site; they are deliberately *not* guessed and committed blind. Gemini,
> ChatGPT, and Claude are verified implementations; the registry is the seam that
> makes adding further providers a config-and-test task rather than a rewrite.

## What is *not* modularized, and why

The flow engine (`handleSolve`, precheck/check/navigate, router, status UI) stays
in `content/index.js`. These functions form a cycle
(`navigateNext → handleStart → handleSolve → moodleCheckAndNavigate → navigateNext`)
and share mutable session state. Splitting them would convert in-file cohesion into
circular cross-module imports — worse architecture, not better. The extracted
modules are all **leaves** (one-way dependencies), which is precisely what makes
them safe to verify by build/unit-test alone. The flow engine is verified by
running the extension in a real browser.

### 10. Runtime Moodle detection (host-agnostic)

flab targets Moodle generically, not specific campus deployments. Rather than
maintaining a hostname allow-list, it detects Moodle at **runtime** via DOM markers
(`isMoodle()` — body classes like `path-mod-quiz`, `.que`/`#responseform` elements,
or a `/mod/quiz/` path). The content script is registered for `https://*/*` but is
**passive on non-Moodle pages**: it only registers a message listener and restores
UI if a session is active; the solve flow is gated on `isMoodlePlatform`.

This is an explicit trade-off: broad host access (`https://*/*`) triggers Chrome's
"read and change data on all websites" warning, in exchange for working on any
Moodle instance without code changes. The mitigation is that nothing acts until
Moodle is detected and the user explicitly starts a session.

## Security posture

- **Broad host access, runtime-gated**: registered for `https://*/*` to support any Moodle, but inert until `isMoodle()` passes and the user starts a session.
- **Least privilege otherwise**: no clipboard permissions; no remote code, fonts, or `eval` (MV3 CSP friendly).
- **Message trust boundary**: handlers validate `sender.id` against the extension's own id.
- **XSS**: all untrusted text (LLM output, page DOM) is escaped before `innerHTML`.
- **Transient sensitive data**: error screenshots in `chrome.storage.local` carry a TTL and a hard count cap.
